#Global Energy Forcasting Competition 2012

This is a project I put together ahead of a job interview.  The GEF competiton was about forcasting and backcasting building energy usage, and matching buildings to their appropriate weather station.  I was able to get a framework up and running in a short amount of time, but I ran into time constraints in tuning the models so my results are not very great.
